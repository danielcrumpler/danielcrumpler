### Hello, my name is Daniel Crumpler. 👋

🏫 I graduated with a Bachlor's of Computer Science at the University of West Georgia.

⚡ I enjoy web and app development, having released [apps](https://apps.apple.com/bt/developer/daniel-crumpler/id1524923152) on Apple's iOS Store.

💬 Outside of development, I am working on receiving my Private Pilot Licence and enjoy spending the small amounts of free time that I have with my friends.
